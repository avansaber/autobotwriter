## Security Enhancements in v1.5.0

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

#### 1. SQL Injection Prevention
- **Issue**: Raw SQL queries without proper escaping
- **Fix**: All queries now use `$wpdb->prepare()` with proper parameter binding
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized database access and manipulation

#### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- **Issue**: Missing nonce validation in AJAX requests
- **Fix**: Implemented WordPress nonce system for all AJAX endpoints
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized actions from malicious websites

#### 3. Input Sanitization
- **Issue**: Insufficient input validation and sanitization
- **Fix**: Comprehensive sanitization using WordPress functions
- **Impact**: Prevents XSS attacks and data corruption

#### 4. API Key Security
- **Issue**: Weak encryption implementation
- **Fix**: Enhanced encryption using WordPress security keys
- **Impact**: Better protection of sensitive API credentials

### Security Features Implemented

#### Authentication & Authorization
- User capability checks for all admin functions
- Proper permission validation for AJAX requests
- Role-based access control for plugin features

#### Data Protection
- Encrypted storage of API keys using WordPress salts
- Sanitized input/output for all user data
- Secure parameter binding for database operations

#### Error Handling
- Secure error messages that don't expose system information
- Proper logging of security events
- Graceful handling of invalid requests

#### Database Security
- Prepared statements for all database queries
- Input validation with type checking
- Proper indexing for performance and security
